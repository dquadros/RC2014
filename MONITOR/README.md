Machine Language Monitor for the RC2014
=======================================

Inspired by the monitor in an old Intel kit (http://oldcomputers.net/intel-mcs-85.html)
and MSDOS debug program.

In the long run support is planned for the following comands:

* A assembly
* C compare
* D dump
* E enter
* F fill
* G go
* I input
* L load (1)
* M move
* O output
* S search
* U unassemble
* W write (1)

(1) load and write will use the XModem protocol to receive and send files from a PC
