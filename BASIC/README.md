BASIC Programs for the RC2014
=============================

heapsort.bas
------------

My heap sort implementation, from Algorithm H in Donald Knuth's 
The Art of Computer Programming vol 3, so it is not a very readable.

dragon.bas
-----------

An adaptation of Dragon Island by Walt Hutchinson, from the September/October
1977 newsletter of the Homebrew Computer Club.

You have to kill a dragon crawling in 10 interconnected caves, before the sun
sets down (at 8 o'clock). In each turn you will throw your spean into a cave,
if you miss you will have to fetch it back. Before you fetch, the dragon can
crawl to an adjacent cave or lurk. As a clue, the dragon will snort if you throw
your spear in a cave next to him.
